    <p>I am using a selector and a declaration in addition to make some modification</p>
    <div class="block">
        <p class="put-color">
           Write this paragraphe please 
        </p>
        <p id="change-size">A element can have unless one id nore</p>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
        <p>
            now try to select all element that the parent is div <br>change the size , style finaly the weight
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="third">
        <p>
            maybe there was a mistake because the block class didnt change , so now let select or elements that are following directly all the div
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
